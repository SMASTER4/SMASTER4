# About me
Hello, I am S-Master4. I am a young **hobby** programmer. I like Linux and open source in general, because it gives me the freedom and power to deside about my PC. I also obviously like programming, because it gives me the tools to do almost anything. I am a bit into game dev from scratch(without a game engine), but I am generally intrested in many things around computers.

I have used:
+ Python (I had bad experiences)
+ **Java**
+ HTML/CSS/JavaScript (You just need those to today)
+ **C**
+ C++ (I found it a little bloaty)
